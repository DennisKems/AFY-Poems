        <p>
            Countless times.
            I've ran away<br>
            All to a dead end.
            But this time,<br>
            It's the dead end of a dead end.
        </p>
        <p>
            No light.
            No air.
            No voice.<br>
            And I can't run away<br>
            Not beacause I do not want to.
            Not because I can not.<br>
            It's just impossibility in itself,
            I don't know what to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mother! where are you?
            Please come for my bones<br>
            That's if they even remain...
            Only if you find my ashes<br>
            You know when they say:
            "I am better off dead"<br>
            These words are kind.
        </p>

        <p>I'm a weakling,
            Non senile,
            Very considerate.<br>
            Mirror mirror on the wall<br>
            Check my physiognomy
            & save me<br>
            From the darts of te mass
        </p>
